<small>On the left side, there is the sidebar with the button to do logout. Next the cheat menu, and the clipboard. On the chat menu, you have the id of your user, the button to create a new chat, and the list of chats. To create a new chat, need the user id from the user that you want to chat. In the clipboard, you can see the messages that you send and the messages that the other user send.
You can delete the chats with the trash icon.
On the clipboard, you can see the messages that you send and the messages that the other user sends. To delete your message, click the right button of your mouse.
